## Translations

Translation files are placed in the folder qgis2mapbender/i18n of the plugin.

You can copy an existing .ts file and translate it to your language (sections translation). 
Please name the new file according to the following scheme: `xx.ts`, where `xx` is the [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) of your language (e.g. `de` for German, `es` for Spanish, `it` for Italian, etc.).
You can use [Qt Linguist](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtlinguist-index.html) to translate the strings in the .ts file.

You have to create a .qm file from the .ts file after translating it. You can use the `lrelease` tool from the Qt framework to do this. The command is as follows:

```
lrelease path/to/yourfile.ts
```

After translating the strings in the .ts file and the creation of the .qm file, please create a pull request with your new translation file included in the i18n folder of the repository. This way, your translation can be included in future releases of the plugin.
