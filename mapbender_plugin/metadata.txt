description=QGIS plugin to populate Mapbender with WMS services from QGIS Server.
about=This QGIS plugin exports your project as a QGIS Server WMS (Web Map Service) and publishes it in a Mapbender application (https://mapbender.org). It requires a web server with QGIS Server and Mapbender installed.

System Requirements:

Local Requirements:
- The QGIS project must be saved in the same folder as the data.
- Install `fabric2`, e.g., using the QGIS console, if the library is not already installed.

Server Requirements:
- QGIS Server must be installed on your server.
- Mapbender must be installed on your server.
- Create at least one template application in Mapbender, which will be cloned to publish a new WMS, or an application that will be used to publish a new WMS. These applications should have at least one layer set:
  - A layer set named "main" (the default layer set for adding a new WMS to the application), OR
  - A layer set with any other name (in this case, the name of the layer set must be specified when using the plugin).
